# ZombieGame
Zombie game created in C++. 

This zombie project took several hours. It was planned to the dot and some very difficult parts where on the way. 
I started off with using a vector to read in information from my File. The File stats information about the game as it startsup. 
string were used thought this program from names to user name ect.
I used a "Player" class to gather a players information.
I used inheritance of the "Zombie" class and used polymorphism. the functions gather the zombies health and attack and the Zombie dog health and attack.
Compistion was used for the "GameStart" class. it takes in players information and uses that to display the player name age and username.
Exceptions was used in void startGameMenu(), character() and randomBox().
Templates was the hardest thing to do. It isnt hard but it took a while for me to think of a good way to put into my program. I used it for a easter egg function. i think its pretty cool.
Templates used  T easterEgg(); and T easterEgg2(); in class "GameStart".
This program was really fun to create. I feel i learn so much doing these kinds of projects rather than tests becasue it gives me a chance of taking my time learning it right then incorprating it into my program the right way.



Extra Credit: 
	Using Maps in character(); I wanted to add sound to the players when selected but i couldnt find the right voiceovers for them or they were just to long.
	Playing Sounds and Screen changing colors in PlayZombie();
